# Days of Reading

Days of Reading is a personal journey of interesting content. A mini project created by [HÃ©ctor Sosa](https://codepen.io/ekqt/).

## How was it built?

The project's HTML is very minimal. Everything is generated from a JavaScript object which acts as a database containing the information the script runs to create all of the elements, assign their classes and interactions with each other.

## An Automated Journal
Here is a list of every automation within the project:
- Days 'n' count since the journal was created (found in the header and footer);
- Color themes for every computed element.
- Filter Tags
- Cards
- Journal Monthly Entry (i.e. January 2021)
- Card Identifier Tags
- Card Count
- Live Time for Brno, Czech Republic ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿
- DarkMode is set automatically at sunrise/sunset times.
